A few Compiler Flags for Optimizing HPL Benchmarks:

1. Architecture related flags
	-march= and -mtune=
These flags allow you to specify the target microarchitecture for which you want to optimize the code. 
Replace = with the appropriate architecture and tuning option for your hardware. Examples include native, skylake, zen2, etc.

2. Vectorization
	-mavx, -mavx2, -mavx512f
These flags enable the use of specific SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instruction sets like AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512, which can greatly accelerate numerical computations.

3. Optimization level
	-O2 and -O3
These flags enable various optimization levels. 
Higher optimization levels can lead to better performance but might also increase compilation time and code size.

4. Parallelization
	-fopenmp
Enable OpenMP parallelization for multithreaded execution.

5. Compiler-provided libraries
	-L and -l
Specify library paths and link against optimized math libraries like Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) or OpenBLAS.

6. Loop unrolling
	-funroll-loops
This flag encourages the compiler to unroll loops, potentially improving performance by reducing loop overhead.

7. Inlining
	-finline-functions
This flag allows the compiler to inline small functions, reducing function call overhead.

8. Floating-point precision
	-ffast-math
This flag enables aggressive floating-point optimizations that might sacrifice precision. 
Be cautious when using this flag for numerical applications.

9. Memory alignment
	-malign-data=cacheline
This flag ensures that data structures are aligned to cache line boundaries, which can improve memory access performance.

10. Profile-guided optimization
	-fprofile-generate
to compile with profiling instrumentation.
	-fprofile-use
for subsequent compilation to optimize based on collected profiling data.
